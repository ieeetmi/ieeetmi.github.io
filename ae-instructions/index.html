<p>Thank you for volunteering as an Associate Editor (AE) of IEEE-TMI! To assist you in carrying out your AE duties, this document provides the procedures and rules that you need to follow. As a distinguished and highly selective journal, TMI’s success depends on your dedication, expertise, and careful management of each manuscript assigned to you.</p>

<h1 id="1-get-ready">1. Get Ready</h1>

<p>To fulfill your role as an Associate Editor for TMI effectively, you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Familiarize yourself with TMI’s scope, key acceptance criteria, and review and decision process.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Review your expertise keywords on ScholarOne and keep them up-to-date.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Read the TMI’s For Reviewers and For Authors Instructions</strong> to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the guidelines for reviewing and submitting manuscripts.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="2-manage-manuscript-review">2. Manage Manuscript Review</h1>

<p>You are responsible for overseeing the review process of manuscripts assigned to you. Upon receiving a manuscript, you are expected to read the cover letter and the manuscript within 3 days, take appropriate actions to carry out the scientific review of the manuscript.</p>

<h2 id="21-original-submissions">2.1. Original Submissions</h2>

<p>Original submissions refer to new submissions that have not been previously submitted or reviewed on ScholarOne.</p>

<h3 id="211-request-reassignment">2.1.1. Request Reassignment</h3>

<p>Contact the Managing Editor to request reassignment of the manuscript if you have any concerns about a potential conflict of interest or feel that the topic of the manuscript is outside of your area of expertise. It is important to ensure that you can focus on evaluating the quality of the research work and make unbiased decisions.</p>

<h3 id="212-recommend-immediate-reject">2.1.2. Recommend Immediate-Reject</h3>

<p>Recommend “Immediate Reject” without pursuing a full review process if you feel the manuscript is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Out of the scope of TMI,</li>
  <li>Does not meet TMI’s quality standards,</li>
  <li>Lacks novelty, or</li>
  <li>Is deemed as just “good” instead of “exceptional” or “excellent.”</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="2121-to-recommend-an-immediate-reject">2.1.2.1 To Recommend an Immediate Reject</h4>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the <strong>Reviews required to make decision</strong> from “4” to “0”.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Make Recommendation</strong> tab will appear. Click on it.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Immediate Reject</strong> option.</li>
  <li>Write a paragraph in the <strong>Comments to the Author</strong> section summarizing the reasons for your recommendation. If you make constructive suggestions, be clear on whether a resubmission—with the suggested changes incorporated—is eligible for a full review at TMI.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="2122-ask-a-2nd-aes-opinion">2.1.2.2 Ask a 2nd AE’s Opinion</h4>

<p>If you intend to recommend an “Immediate Reject” but are not totally certain, you may request to have a second AE’s opinion. In this case:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Repeat the Immediate Reject steps 1–4 above.</li>
  <li>Write your comments/rationale in the <strong>Confidential Comments to the Editor</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>ADM: Yao, Rutao</strong> to send an email to the Managing Editor (ME) about your request for a second AE’s opinion. If you use your regular email App, please include the manuscript ID in your email.</li>
</ol>

<p>The EiC/ME will assign the manuscript to a second AE. The second AE may:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agree with the first AE’s recommendation.</strong> Action: Make a recommendation that may include the first AE’s comments within 7 days of the assignment.</li>
  <li><strong>Arrive at a different conclusion than the first AE.</strong> Action: Proceed to manage the full review of the manuscript.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which path the 2nd AE takes, he/she will inform (email) the first AE of his/her intention, as a collegial information exchange. The first AE’s name is visible on the right-hand side of the <strong>Make Recommendation</strong> screen. The two AEs are encouraged to discuss the manuscript to reach a recommendation.</p>

<p>If a manuscript receives an “Immediate Reject” recommendation, the Editor-in-Chief will use the comments provided by the AEs verbatim (unless you indicate otherwise) or paraphrase them in the decision letter to the author. The Associate Editors will not be identified in the decision letter nor in the submission records on ScholarOne Manuscripts. The Immediate Reject decision letter typically reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Editorial Board has carefully considered the information presented in your manuscript and has decided not to send it out for external peer review. Our consensus is that your manuscript is not suitable for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is followed by “Comments from the Editorial Board” without your name.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of comments that could be provided to authors:</p>

<p><strong>Example #1:</strong><br />
“The authors present techniques for delineating and segmenting tumours in KV x-ray images. The paper is very well written and all decisions, in design, are well justified. However, from a methodological novelty perspective, the paper is lacking (to the level of a TMI paper) and is closer to an application of known techniques in DL in yet another, but very interesting, imaging modality. As TMI reviewers do typically look for methodological novelty and contribution to the broader area of medical image analysis, the editorial board has decided to expedite the review process for the benefit of the authors by providing a more immediate decision.”</p>

<p><strong>Example #2:</strong><br />
“The authors propose a simple CNN for the detection and monitoring of thermal lesions using US RF backscattered from ablated regions. Unfortunately, the paper lacks novelty in methodology and applies a very simple CNN to a medical application. Therefore, it is more suitable for applied medical imaging or clinical journals not for TMI where the novelty of the approach is an important factor.”</p>

<p><strong>Example #3:</strong><br />
“The manuscript is on the evaluation and optimization of an improved dictionary search method for MRF. As TMI publishes works with significant methodological novelty and contribution, the authors are recommended to submit the manuscript to an MRI specific journal such as Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.”</p>

<p><strong>Example #4:</strong><br />
“While your work is interesting and has merit, it is also somewhat incremental in nature. We have the following track record of your works on closely related subjects to your submission.</p>

<p>The MMC framework for EIT was published in IEEE TMI in 2019:<br />
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8721167">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8721167</a></p>

<p>EIT imaging using B-spline level sets was also published in IEEE TMI in 2019:<br />
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8941074">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8941074</a></p>

<p>The use of multiphase conductivity imaging with EIT using the B-spline level set method was published in IEEE Trans on Instrumentation and Measurements earlier in 2020:<br />
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9127902">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9127902</a></p>

<p>Your submitted work seems to be basically the same approach, replacing level sets with MMC. This is not sufficient innovation for IEEE TMI.</p>

<p>EIT shape reconstruction using Boolean operators was published in IEEE TMI in 2020:<br />
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9046034">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9046034</a></p>

<p>and Fourier representations, also in 2020:<br />
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220135">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9220135</a></p>

<p>Please be mindful that the journal cannot accept submissions that are essentially modifications of the same idea. Novelty drives us forward, and innovation is key to the journal’s high ranking.”</p>

<p>In the past, AEs have appreciated the option of an Immediate Reject instead of requesting reviews for a manuscript that is unlikely to be accepted after a full review. This approach aims to reduce reviewer fatigue and shorten the time to the first decision, allowing authors to quickly submit to another journal. The Immediate Reject rate for submissions in 2022 was 34%.</p>

<h3 id="213-submission-extended-from-a-conference-proceeding-paper">2.1.3. Submission Extended from a Conference Proceeding Paper</h3>

<p>For papers extended from conference proceedings, we demand a comprehensive and significant enhancement of the manuscript content (rigor, clarity, and completeness) including figures. There is no need for additional methodology novelty compared to the conference paper.</p>

<h3 id="214-poor-english">2.1.4. Poor English</h3>

<p>If a manuscript has poor English that prevents the assessment of the merit of the submission, you may recommend “Immediate Reject” while indicating in your comment that the authors must use a professional English editing and proofreading agency and provide copies of the certificate of the service and the credentials of the agency should they wish to resubmit. Once the authors have resubmitted the paper along with proof of English editing service, the paper will be reassigned to you for further review.</p>

<h3 id="215-carry-out-a-full-review">2.1.5. Carry out a Full-Review</h3>

<h4 id="2151-reviewer-selection">2.1.5.1. Reviewer Selection</h4>

<p>If you decide to proceed with the full review process, please make every effort to manage and monitor each stage of the review process promptly. The ranking of TMI is partially dependent on turn-around time, so it is essential to keep the review process moving efficiently.</p>

<h4 id="2152-invite-4-reviewers-within-3-days">2.1.5.2. Invite 4 Reviewers Within 3 Days</h4>

<p>As an AE, you are required to select and invite at least four reviewers within three days of being assigned a manuscript. We strongly recommend that you select more than four reviewers, as it is likely that some will decline the invitation. If less than four reviewers are invited after three days, reviewer selection will be considered past due. You will receive reminder emails after 5 and 10 days past due. Please try to avoid selecting reviewers who were trained in the same research group or from regions of proximity. This will help ensure objectivity and minimize potential conflicts of interest during the review process.</p>

<p>Here is an explanation of the related terms on your Associate Editor Dashboard:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Awaiting Reviewer Selection:</strong> Less than 4 reviewers have been selected for a manuscript.</li>
  <li><strong>Awaiting Reviewer Invitation:</strong> At least 4 reviewers have been selected, but less than 4 have been invited.</li>
  <li><strong>Awaiting Reviewer Assignment:</strong> At least 4 reviewers have been invited, but less than 4 have agreed to review.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2153-opposed-reviewers-by-authors">2.1.5.3. Opposed Reviewers by Authors</h4>

<p>As the managing AE, it is your responsibility to select qualified reviewers to conduct a fair and unbiased review. While you may take the authors’ oppositions of reviewers into consideration, you are not obligated to follow them. The recommended practice is to avoid using reviewers opposed by the authors and to be cautious about possible conflicts of interest in using reviewers.</p>

<p>In rare cases, we may receive complaints about unfair or unethical practices in the peer-review process. If you receive such complaints, please report them immediately to the Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editor for further investigation.</p>

<h4 id="2154-reviewer-account-issues">2.1.5.4. Reviewer Account Issues</h4>

<p>If you encounter difficulty inviting a reviewer due to duplicate accounts in the ScholarOne system, please report the issue to the Editorial Office. This will allow the office to merge the duplicate accounts, resolving the issue and enabling you to successfully invite the reviewer to participate in the review process.</p>

<h4 id="2155-select-reviewers-using-scholarones-built-in-functions">2.1.5.5. Select Reviewers Using ScholarOne’s Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>When using the <strong>Reviewer Locator Results</strong> from the Web of Science, it is important to note that the suggested reviewers may or may not have highly relevant expertise to the submitted manuscript (e.g., an insignificant co-author of a relevant publication). Please check each suggested reviewer’s expertise carefully (using Google Scholar or their personal webpage) before inviting them to review, especially if the suggested reviewer has never reviewed any TMI manuscripts before.</p>

<p>The <strong>Quick Search</strong> feature allows you to add a potential reviewer for the manuscript quickly. If you know of anyone who could be a suitable reviewer for the manuscript, this feature can save time in the selection process.</p>

<p>The <strong>Auto-Suggest</strong> feature searches for reviewers with the selected manuscript keywords. These keywords are TMI-specific keywords chosen by the author during submission. This function can be helpful in identifying reviewers with the appropriate expertise for the manuscript.</p>

<h4 id="2156-check-a-reviewers-credentials">2.1.5.6. Check a Reviewer’s Credentials</h4>

<p>Once you have identified a potential reviewer with the appropriate expertise, it is important to check their review history. For each search result, you will see the reviewer’s name, specialty keywords, institution, roles, number of papers currently under review, number of papers reviewed in the past 12 months, number of days since the last review, average R-score (reviewer-score), and average M-score (manuscript-score, which is not activated in TMI at this time). The average R-score represents the combined score for the timely review and quality of the review. A high average R-score (with 3.00 being the highest value) suggests a highly responsible reviewer. By checking a potential reviewer’s review history, you can get an idea of their reliability, promptness, and the quality of their reviews. This information can help you select the best reviewers for a manuscript and ensure a high-quality review process.</p>

<p>Please also note that you are expected to grade a reviewer’s review when it is returned to you (see Section 2.1.6 for instructions).</p>

<p>For some reviewers, there are flags next to their names, indicating certain characteristics or potential issues. Here are the definitions of the flags that may appear next to a reviewer’s name:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Review Turn-around &lt;= 25 days:</strong> Green flag</li>
  <li><strong>Review Turn-around &gt;= 50 days:</strong> Black flag</li>
  <li><strong>Review accurate &amp; detailed:</strong> Blue flag</li>
  <li><strong>Review brief, irrelevant, biased:</strong> Grey flag</li>
  <li><strong>Review &gt;=10 TMI papers:</strong> Yellow flag</li>
  <li><strong>Review &lt;=3 TMI papers:</strong> White flag</li>
  <li><strong>Record of unethical incidents:</strong> Red flag</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to consider these flags when selecting reviewers and to use your judgment in deciding whether to invite a particular reviewer based on the flag and the overall review history.</p>

<p>Editorial Board members (EiC, Managing Editor, and AEs) are authorized to tag flags to a reviewer based on their review history.</p>

<p>In addition to the flags that may appear next to a reviewer’s name, you can also access a <strong>Reviewer History Analysis</strong> by clicking on the magnifier-glass icon next to a reviewer’s name. The Reviewer History Analysis provides additional information about the reviewer’s review history with the journal, including the number of manuscripts the reviewer has declined and agreed to review to date (click “Show All” for more details), as well as the title, authors, turn-around time, and R-score for each manuscript they have reviewed. The information is usually very helpful in determining whether a particular reviewer is a good fit for the manuscript.</p>

<p>It is important to avoid selecting reviewers with very long turn-around times, biased reviews, or who have been declining many review invitations. Inexperienced reviewers should also be selected with caution, and their lack of experience should be taken into consideration when making a recommendation. It is important to prioritize those who have a track record of providing timely and high-quality reviews.</p>

<p>A red flag tagged to a user account indicates the person has at least one incidence of violating the policies of TMI, such as plagiarism or behavior undermining the integrity of the peer-review process. A red flag disqualifies anyone from being a TMI reviewer.</p>

<h4 id="2157-follow-up-with-reviewers">2.1.5.7. Follow Up with Reviewers</h4>

<p>As an AE, it is important to ensure that assigned reviewers submit their reviews in a timely manner and to take appropriate action when necessary to ensure the completion of the review process. Assigned Reviewers have 3 weeks to submit their reviews, and automatic reminders are sent to each reviewer through the ScholarOne system just prior to the 3-week deadline and periodically afterward. A total of five reminders are sent, including reminders at 7 and 2 days before the due date, and 5, 10, and 15 days after the due date. The 10 and 15-day overdue reminders are sent out in your name, and you are copied on these two emails.</p>

<p>After receiving the 15-day overdue reminder, the AE should send a personal email to the reviewer to inquire about the status of the review.</p>

<p><strong>An email example to a reviewer:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear John,<br />
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on the review that you agreed to complete for this manuscript.<br />
As you know, we are still awaiting your review, and we currently do not have enough reviews to make a decision on this manuscript. I understand that you may have other commitments, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know when you anticipate being able to complete your review.<br />
Your expert opinion is critical to the success of the review process, and we value your contributions to the journal. If you are unable to complete the review, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can find a replacement reviewer.<br />
Thank you for your time and consideration. Looking forward to hearing from you.<br />
Best regards,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is still no response, the AE should take immediate actions such as un-assigning the reviewer, inviting a new reviewer for a quick review, or making a recommendation based on the available reviews.</p>

<p>In order to make a decision on a manuscript, there must be at least 3, but preferably 4, reviews. The AE should strive to obtain at least 3 reviews in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h4 id="2158-grant-due-date-extensions">2.1.5.8. Grant Due-date Extensions</h4>

<p>Reviewers may request an extension of the due date for submitting their reviews. Generally, requests for extensions of up to two or even three weeks should be granted without question. However, for longer requests or repeated requests, it is important to consider the following factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are there already adequate reviews in agreement to make a recommendation?</li>
  <li>Is there already a strong review that recommends rejection, making it unlikely for the paper to receive a positive decision?</li>
  <li>Has the review length passed the 60-day mark?</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of these factors apply, it may be appropriate to take action to move the review process forward. This could include un-assigning the reviewer and finding a replacement, or making a recommendation based on the available reviews.</p>
